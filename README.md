https://movie-recommender-g2oe.onrender.com/

## 📌 Features

🔍 Search for a movie and get similar movie recommendations

🎭 Uses movie metadata (genres, keywords, overview, cast, crew)

📊 Machine Learning with cosine similarity

🖼 Fetches posters using TMDB API

☁️ Deployed on Render

🔐 Secure API key handling using environment variables

📦 Large ML models managed with Git LFS


## 🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend / UI: Streamlit

Backend / ML: Python, Scikit-learn

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Model Storage: Pickle (.pkl)

Deployment: Render

Version Control: Git & GitHub (Git LFS - for large ML artifacts)


## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Movie metadata is combined into a single tags column

Text data is vectorized using CountVectorizer

Cosine similarity is used to find similar movies

When a user selects a movie, the system recommends the top similar movies

Think of it like: movies with similar words → similar vectors → similar recommendations
